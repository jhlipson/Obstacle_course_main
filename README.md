# Obstacle-course-MAIN
 
Hi there! This is a quick tutorial on how to play my Obstacle Course game. WASD to move or use a controller. Press on the left shift button on down on a joystick to go from a jog to a sprint. Space or Jump button on a controller (You have a double jump). Right click on the mouse to dash either on the ground or in mid air, only in the direction you are facing. You can only dash once in mid-air. Control the camera with your mouse. Use the blue cube at the start of the game to skip the level and see the end to see how I manipulate the camera if you wish to simply skip the level and see what I ended up doing there. Finally, watch out for the game over as it will reset your progress and try and pick up health pickups! Good luck, hope you like it!
